Synopsis: 
Elden Ring is an action RPG developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco. The game
takes place in the Lands Between, a vast open world ruled by demigods who each possess a fragment
of the powerful Elden Ring. These fragments, known as Great Runes, have corrupted their wielders,
leading to a war known as the Shattering and the collapse of the Golden Order.

The player takes on the role of a Tarnished, an exile summoned back to the Lands Between with the
goal of reassembling the Elden Ring and becoming the next Elden Lord. To achieve this, the Tarnished
must traverse a dangerous world filled with formidable enemies, powerful bosses, and deep lore
hidden in its ruins. Along the journey, they encounter allies and foes, each with their own motivations,
as they uncover the true nature of the Elden Ring and the gods that govern the realm.
