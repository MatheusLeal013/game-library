Super Mario World is a classic 2D platformer released by Nintendo in 1990
for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). The game follows Mario
and Luigi as they embark on a quest to rescue Princess Peach from Bowser,
who has kidnapped her and taken her to his castle in Dinosaur Land.

As the brothers explore Dinosaur Land, they traverse multiple worlds filled
with treacherous obstacles, enemies, and hidden secrets. Along the way, they
encounter Yoshi, a friendly dinosaur who aids them by eating enemies and gaining
special abilities depending on the color of the shells he consumes.

The game introduces new mechanics, such as the Cape Feather, which allows Mario
to fly, and an expansive overworld map with branching paths and hidden exits.
Players must navigate through various themed areas, including forests, caves,
and ghost houses, ultimately facing off against Bowser in his castle to save Princess Peach.

World remains one of the most beloved and influential games in the Mario franchise.
