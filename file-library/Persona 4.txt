Synopsis: 
Persona 5 follows a high school student falsely accused of assault and sent to Tokyo for probation.
There, he discovers the Metaverse, a parallel world formed by humanity's collective unconscious.
Awakening his Persona, he leads the Phantom Thieves of Hearts, a group of students who reform
corrupt adults by infiltrating their Palaces—manifestations of twisted desires—and stealing their
"Treasures" to force changes of heart.

As the Phantom Thieves gain notoriety, they face growing challenges from the public, law
enforcement, and shadowy conspiracies, all while uncovering deeper truths about society's
corruption and their fight for freedom.
